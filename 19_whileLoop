// Initializing a variable 'index' with value 0
let index = 0;

// While loop: Executes as long as the condition (index <= 10) is true
// while (index <= 10) {
//     console.log(`Value of index is ${index}`); // Prints the current value of 'index'
//     index = index + 2; // Increments index by 2 in each iteration
// }
// The above loop prints even numbers from 0 to 10 (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10)


// Array declaration
let myArray = ['flash', "batman", "superman"];

// Initializing an iterator variable 'arr' with 0
let arr = 0;

// While loop: Iterates over the array using 'arr' as an index
while (arr < myArray.length) { // Condition: Runs until 'arr' reaches the length of 'myArray'
    // console.log(`Value is ${myArray[arr]}`); // Prints the current element of the array
    arr = arr + 1; // Moves to the next element in the array
}

// The above loop will print:
// Value is flash
// Value is batman
// Value is superman


// Demonstrating a 'do-while' loop
let score = 11; // Initializing 'score' with 11

do {
    console.log(`Score is ${score}`); // Prints the current value of 'score'
    score++; // Increments 'score' by 1
} while (score <= 10); // Condition: The loop will continue as long as 'score' is <= 10

// Explanation:
// - Unlike a 'while' loop, a 'do-while' loop always executes at least once, even if the condition is false.
// - In this case, the initial value of 'score' is 11, which already fails the condition (score <= 10).
// - However, since the 'do' block runs before checking the condition, it prints "Score is 11" once, then stops.
